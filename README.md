## Mode 1

When playing a game with 0 increment, it creates 2 clock dials. Each dial matches percentage of time for each player.
For a game with increment you will see a single dial split for both players. Each section representing time available to a player.

This helps you judge time each player has by comparing dial shapes in peripheral vision rather than looking at numbers and comparing them.  I find it much easier to make sense of remaining time.

Supports if browser is greater than 900 px.
